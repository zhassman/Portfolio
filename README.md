# Portfolio

## Repository Overview
Welcome to my portfolio / project archive! This is a home for a few of the projects I have done.

## Featured Projects

### Password Cracking 
- **Description**: A collection of scripts for password security analysis, including password hash extraction, cracking with Hashcat, and probabilistic password generation using Markov models.
- **Highlights**:
  - In-depth analysis of password datasets.
  - Practical experience with Hashcat for password cracking.
  - Implementation of Markov models for password strength evaluation.

### MyShell 
- **Description**: A simple shell environment called `myshell` that allows for interactive and batch command processing, designed for Unix-like systems.
- **Highlights**:
  - Custom shell implementation using system calls like `fork()`, `execvp()`, and `dup2()`.
  - Features such as command parsing, error handling, and I/O redirection.

### Wireshark Browsing History 
- **Description**: Utilizes network packet data to reconstruct the browsing history of a user known as "ghost", employing techniques like web scraping and traffic analysis.
- **Highlights**:
  - Network traffic analysis and web data scraping.
  - Reconstruction of user behavior on the internet.
  - Efficient data processing and visualization of network interactions.

### TrieOrthographer 
- **Description**: `TrieOrthographer` is a trie-based orthography tool designed for spell-checking and word completion. Tries are a kind of search tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. This project uses trie structures to manage a large dataset of words efficiently, allowing for rapid search, insert, and delete operations.
- **Highlights**:
  - Efficient management of words using trie data structures for each letter of the alphabet.
  - Features including word insertion, presence check, completions, word counting, and extraction of all words.
  - Implements both direct word insertion and bulk insertion from files.

### Flight Data with Pandas
- **Description**: This module processes and analyzes ASQP flight data, focusing on delays, cancellations, and operational metrics using Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries.
- **Highlights**:
  - Data handling for complex flight datasets.
  - Analytical functions for calculating flight delays, cancellations, and performance metrics.
  - Time series analysis for identifying trends and seasonality in flight data.
 
### Slide 15 Game
- **Description**: A C implementation of the classic Slide 15 puzzle game where players move tiles into numerical order by sliding them into an empty space.
- **Highlights**:
  - Direct manipulation of tile positions based on user inputs.
  - Automatic tile shuffling at the start to randomize the board.
  - Comprehensive checks to determine when the puzzle is solved.

### Student Database System
- **Description**: Consists of two core implementations: `hash.c` and `binary.c`. `hash.c` utilizes hash tables to efficiently manage student records, while `binary.c` employs binary search trees for optimized data operations.
- **Highlights**:
  - `hash.c`: Features hash tables for quick data retrieval and management, ensuring data integrity through uniqueness checks.
  - `binary.c`: Utilizes binary search trees for efficient sorting and rapid access, with a focus on memory management and preventing data duplication.
  - Both implementations provide robust error handling, dynamic memory management, and support complex data structures for high-performance data operations.

### Grayscale Image Conversion
- **Description**: Grayscale is a project designed to convert color images to grayscale using both sequential and parallel processing techniques to showcase different performance efficiencies.
- **Highlights**:
  - Implements grayscale conversion algorithms using C and pthreads for parallel processing.
  - Measures and compares performance between sequential and multi-threaded execution.
  - Provides practical applications of parallel computing in image processing tasks.
