This C program implements a simple shell, myshell, that supports executing 
commands in both interactive and batch modes. It features built-in commands 
(cd, pwd, exit), input/output redirection, and advanced appending redirection. 
The shell manages error handling, command parsing, and supports executing 
multiple commands separated by semicolons. It's designed to provide a basic 
yet functional shell environment in Unix-like systems.
